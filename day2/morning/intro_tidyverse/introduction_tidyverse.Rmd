# Today's outline

???

- Tidyverse: A collection of very usefule R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying philosophy and data structures.
- Dpylr: Package for data manipulation
- ggplot2: One of the most well-known packages of the Tidyverse. 
- Final exercise: Goal is to combine everything that you've learnt during these two days.

--

- What you have learnt so far

--

- Taking it a step further – introducing the Tidyverse

--

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`

--

- Data visualisation with `ggplot2`

--

- Final exercise

--

- Feedback & concluding remarks

---

# What you have learnt so far

???

- Familiarity: You know where the console is, where the plots are shown and where your datasets are listed
- Scripts: How to work in a script, most important style rules, legible code
- Data structures: You know what dataframes, matrices, vectors, etc. are. Lastly, you can do simple data manipulations and visualize your data. 

--

-	Familiar with the RStudio interface

--

-	Working with scripts

--

-	Simple data structures 

--

-	First data wrangling and visualisations

---

# Tidy data – a philosophy of data 

???

- A supposedly intuitive concept put into words by Wickham in 2014
- The underlying goal is to standardize or simplify data analysis
- The definiton goes as follows.
- However, the rule "Each type of observational unit is a table" can often no longer be considered when merging datasets
- which is why the first two conditions are especially important for understanding what tidy data is.

--

-	[Wickham (2014)](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) aimed to standardise the data preparation process

<h4>
«Each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.»
</h4>
]

--

```{r}
head(table1, n = 4) %>% 
  kable(format = "html")
```

---

# Another example

```{r, echo=F}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r}
head(penguins, n = 5) %>% 
  select(1:5) %>% 
  kable(format = "html")
```

## From tidy data to the tidyverse

???

- So what is the Tidyverse then?
- It is a self-contained environment that includes a total of 8 tools or packages
- The main goal in its most general form is to facilitate the work with data
- In the meantime, a universe has indeed slowly formed around this tidy philosophy

--

-	The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

--

- Its tools (read: packages) use/generate tidy data both as input/output

--

-	`dplyr`: Helps to transform messy data to tidy data

--

-	`ggplot2`: Uses tidy data to create graphics

--

-	Facilitate data analysis/visualisation

Questions?

### How does Base R relate to the Tidyverse?

???

- Delving in a delicate topic, namely the relationship between R and the Tidyverse
- Clarify: Yesterday Base R, today Tidyverse
- The following examples are intended to show how the syntax of the two approaches differs
- Don't worry about the coding itself, you'll learn that throughout the day

--

- Yesterday you learnt Base R commands, today Tidyverse commands

--

- Two different approaches to achieve the same goal

--

- <b> Treat them as friends! </b>

--

- A few examples

---

### Extract columns

#### Base R

```{r, results='hide'}
penguins[, c("island", "year")] # by name
penguins[, c(2, 8)]  # by column index
```

#### Tidyverse

```{r, results='hide'}
select(penguins, island, year) # by name
select(penguins, 2, 8)  # by column index
```

---

### Extract observations (rows)

#### Base R

```{r, results='hide'}
# Using [,]
penguins[penguins$body_mass_g > 3500 & penguins$island == "Torgersen",]
```

#### Tidyverse

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(penguins, body_mass_g > 3500 & island == "Torgersen")
```

---

???

- A few examples to show the differences between the two approaches
- Again, none of them is per se better than the other and you can obtain the very same results with both 
- However, especially for beginners, the Tidyverse is arguably a more intuitive way to get there
- Nevertheless, a decent knowledge of Base R is essential to better understand more advanced functions. So keep in mind that both approaches are equal and each has its own advantages.
- One thing remains before we can conclude the Introduction to the Tidyverse: The pipe.

--

### Filter rows with conditions evaluated within groups

In words: Penguin with maximum “bill_length_mm” for each “species”.

#### Base R

```{r, results='hide'}
# First operate in the data.frame by group (split-apply)
largest_bills <- by(penguins, 
                    INDICES = penguins$species, 
                    FUN = function(x){
                      x[x$bill_length_mm == max(x$bill_length_mm, 
                                                na.rm = T), ] 
                    })

# Then combine the results into a data.frame
do.call(rbind, largest_bills)
```

#### Tidyverse

```{r, results='hide'}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  filter(bill_length_mm == max(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Introducing the pipe

???

- Maybe you have already asked yourself during the presentation what this sign does.
- The pipe is a very useful tool that takes some time to get used to, but is extremely practical once you have understood it. It also makes the code much easier to read.
- In the following example we will get to know the pipe step by step.

--

- The pipe operator: `%>%`

--

-  Takes one return value and feeds it in as an iput to another function

--

- Think of it as: "and then"

--

- Helps you to write code in a way that is easier to read and understand

--

```{r, results='hide'}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, island, sex, bill_length_mm, year) #<<
```

--

```{r, results='hide'}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, island, sex, bill_length_mm, year) %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) #<<
```

--

```{r, results='hide'}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, island, sex, bill_length_mm, year) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(island) #<<
```

---

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm, year) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

--

#### Base R equivalent

```{r}
penguins <- penguins[,c("species", "island", "bill_length_mm", "year")]

penguins <- penguins[penguins$year == 2007, ]

penguins <- penguins[!(is.na(penguins$bill_length_mm)),]

tapply(penguins$bill_length_mm, penguins$island, mean)
```
