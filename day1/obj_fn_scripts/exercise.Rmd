1. Create a new project and check out the new working directory. 

2. Open a new script.

3. Create both a numeric and a character vector.

4. Once that's done, apply functions such as mean() or sqrt() to the numeric vector and relevel the character vector. If you don't know how the relevel()-function works, check out the corresponding help file.

5. Quick tip: Check out the handy shortcuts that help you navigate the RStudio IDE a lot easier! Try to find the shortcut for the assignment operator to save a lot of time in the future. You can also customize these shortcuts if you like!

6. Save one of your vectors as an R object. 

7. Download some of the datasets provided here (Link: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/) and load them into your workspace.

8. If you're all done with that, help your peers!
